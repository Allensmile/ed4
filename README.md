# Computational Cognitive Neuroscience, Fourth Edition

This is the 4th edition of the online, freely available textbook, originally written in MediaWiki:

This version is written in markdown format, and converted into various other end-user formats using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/index.html) with the assistance of the https://github.com/bmc/ebook-template python script.

# Formats

* [HTML](https://github.com/CompCogNeuro/ed4/blob/master/ccnbook_ed4.html)

* [ePub](https://github.com/CompCogNeuro/ed4/blob/master/ccnbook_ed4.epub) -- opens in e.g., Mac iBooks

A Kindle version will be available shortly, and we're also working on printed & bound versions as well.

# TODO

* and all the sims questions and points info in sims, also do release there and add links to release directly.

* and add links here to released textbook versions!

* ch7: fix bg description of da learning -- kinda buried
* ch7: update PVLV to latest bvPVLV version -- use pvlv readme?

* ch8: update theta, add pmn / atn stuff -- in general discussion is a bit disorganized and out-of-date.

* ch10: todo: nback model, hierarchical control model
