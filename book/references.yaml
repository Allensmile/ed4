  title: 'Deep predictive learning: A comprehensive model of three visual streams'
  title-short: Deep Predictive Learning
  container-title: arXiv:1709.04654 \[q-bio\]
  abstract: 'How does the neocortex learn and develop the foundations of all our high-level
    cognitive abilities? We present a comprehensive framework spanning biological,
    computational, and cognitive levels, with a clear theoretical continuity between
    levels, providing a coherent answer directly supported by extensive data at each
    level. Learning is based on making predictions about what the senses will report
    at 100 msec (alpha frequency) intervals, and adapting synaptic weights to improve
    prediction accuracy. The pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus serves as a projection
    screen upon which predictions are generated, through deep-layer 6 corticothalamic
    inputs from multiple brain areas and levels of abstraction. The sparse driving
    inputs from layer 5 intrinsic bursting neurons provide the target signal, and
    the temporal difference between it and the prediction reverberates throughout
    the cortex, driving synaptic changes that approximate error backpropagation, using
    only local activation signals in equations derived directly from a detailed biophysical
    model. In vision, predictive learning requires a carefully-organized developmental
    progression and anatomical organization of three pathways (What, Where, and What
    \* Where), according to two central principles: top-down input from compact, high-level,
    abstract representations is essential for accurate prediction of low-level sensory
    inputs; and the collective, low-level prediction error must be progressively and
    opportunistically partitioned to enable extraction of separable factors that drive
    the learning of further high-level abstractions. Our model self-organized systematic
    invariant object representations of 100 different objects from simple movies,
    accounts for a wide range of data, and makes many testable predictions.'

  title: Striatal D1 and D2 signaling differentially predict learning from positive
    and negative outcomes
  container-title: NeuroImage
  page: 95-101
  volume: '109'
  abstract: The extent to which we learn from positive and negative outcomes of decisions
    is modulated by the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine neurons burst fire in
    response to unexpected rewards and pause following negative outcomes. This dual
    signaling mechanism is hypothesized to drive both approach and avoidance behavior.
    Here we test a prediction deriving from a computational reinforcement learning
    model, in which approach is mediated via activation of the direct cortico-striatal
    pathway due to striatal D1 receptor stimulation, while avoidance occurs via disinhibition
    of indirect pathway striatal neurons secondary to a reduction of D2 receptor stimulation.
    Using positron emission tomography with two separate radioligands, we demonstrate
    that individual differences in human approach and avoidance learning are predicted
    by variability in striatal D1 and D2 receptor binding, respectively. Moreover,
    transient dopamine precursor depletion improved learning from negative outcomes.
    These findings support a bidirectional modulatory role for striatal dopamine in
    reward and avoidance learning via segregated D1 and D2 cortico-striatal pathways.

  title: A new neural framework for visuospatial processing
  container-title: Nature Reviews Neuroscience
  page: 217-230
  volume: '12'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: The division of cortical visual processing into distinct dorsal and ventral
    streams is a key framework that has guided visual neuroscience. The characterization
    of the ventral stream as a ’What’ pathway is relatively uncontroversial, but the
    nature of dorsal stream processing is less clear. Originally proposed as mediating
    spatial perception (’Where’), more recent accounts suggest it primarily serves
    non-conscious visually guided action (’How’). Here, we identify three pathways
    emerging from the dorsal stream that consist of projections to the prefrontal
    and premotor cortices, and a major projection to the medial temporal lobe that
    courses both directly and indirectly through the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial
    cortices. These three pathways support both conscious and non-conscious visuospatial
    processing, including spatial working memory, visually guided action and navigation,
    respectively.

  title-short: Synaptic Modifications in Cultured Hippocampal Neurons
  container-title: The Journal of Neuroscience
  page: 10464-10472
  volume: '18'
  issue: '24'
  abstract: In cultures of dissociated rat hippocampal neurons, persistent potentiation
    and depression of glutamatergic synapses were induced by correlated spiking of
    presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. The relative timing between the presynaptic
    and postsynaptic spiking determined the direction and the extent of synaptic changes.
    Repetitive postsynaptic spiking within a time window of 20 msec after presynaptic
    activation resulted in long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas postsynaptic spiking
    within a window of 20 msec before the repetitive presynaptic activation led to
    long-term depression (LTD). Significant LTP occurred only at synapses with relatively
    low initial strength, whereas the extent of LTD did not show obvious dependence
    on the initial synaptic strength. Both LTP and LTD depended on the activation
    of NMDA receptors and were absent in cases in which the postsynaptic neurons were
    GABAergic in nature. Blockade of L-type calcium channels with nimodipine abolished
    the induction of LTD and reduced the extent of LTP. These results underscore the
    importance of precise spike timing, synaptic strength, and postsynaptic cell type
    in the activity-induced modification of central synapses and suggest that Hebb’s
    rule may need to incorporate a quantitative consideration of spike timing that
    reflects the narrow and asymmetric window for the induction of synaptic modification.

  volume: '13'
  issue: '10'
  abstract: Although the perirhinal cortex (PRC), parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and
    retrosplenial cortex (RSC) have an essential role in memory, the precise functions
    of these areas are poorly understood. Here, we review the anatomical and functional
    characteristics of these areas based on studies in humans, monkeys and rats. Our
    Review suggests that the PRC and PHCRSC are core components of two separate large-scale
    cortical networks that are dissociable by neuroanatomy, susceptibility to disease
    and function. These networks not only support different types of memory but also
    appear to support different aspects of cognition.

  title-short: Simple Memory
  container-title: 'Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological
    Sciences'
  page: 23-81
  volume: '262'
  issue: '841'
  abstract: It is proposed that the most important characteristic of archicortex is
    its ability to perform a simple kind of memorizing task. It is shown that rather
    general numerical constraints roughly determine the dimensions of memorizing models
    for the mammalian brain, and from these is derived a general model for archicortex.
    The addition of further constraints leads to the notion of a simple representation,
    which is a way of translating a great deal of information into the firing of about
    200 out of a population of 10$<$latex$>\$\sphat$5\$$<$/latex$>$ cells. It is shown
    that if about 10$<$latex$>\$\sphat$5\$$<$/latex$>$ simple representations are
    stored in such a population of cells, very little information about a single learnt
    event is necessary to provoke its recall. A detailed numerical examination is
    made of a particular example of this kind of memory, and various general conclusions
    are drawn from the analysis. The insight gained from these models is used to derive
    theories for various archicortical areas. A functional interpretation is given
    of the cells and synapses of the area entorhinalis, the prcsubiculum, the prosubiculum,
    the cornu ammonis and the fascia dentata. Many predictions are made, a substantial
    number of which must be true if the theory is correct. A general functional classification
    of typical archicortical cells is proposed.

    apply it to a detailed conductance-based model of a regular spiking neuron. Our
    simple model predicts correctly the timing of 96% of the spikes ($\pm$2 ms) of
    the detailed model in response to injection of noisy synaptic conductances. The
    model is especially reliable in high-conductance states, typical of cortical activity
    in vivo, in which intrinsic conductances were found to have a reduced role in
    shaping spike trains. These results are promising because this simple model has
    enough expressive power to reproduce qualitatively several electrophysiological
    classes described in vitro.

  page: 726-742
  volume: '23'
  issue: '9'
  abstract: What are the principles that govern whether neural representations move
    apart (differentiate) or together (integrate) as a function of learning? According
    to supervised learning models that are trained to predict outcomes in the world,
    integration should occur when two stimuli predict the same outcome. Numerous findings
    support this, but paradoxically some recent fMRI studies have found that pairing
    different stimuli with the same associate causes differentiation, not integration.
    To explain these and related findings, we argue that supervised learning needs
    to be supplemented with unsupervised learning that is driven by spreading activation
    in a U-shaped way, such that inactive memories are not modified, moderate activation
    of memories causes weakening (leading to differentiation), and higher activation
    causes strengthening (leading to integration).

  title-short: Anatomy of hierarchy
  container-title: Journal of Comparative Neurology
  page: 225-259
  volume: '522'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: 'The laminar location of the cell bodies and terminals of interareal connections
    determines the hierarchical structural organization of the cortex and has been
    intensively studied. However, we still have only a rudimentary understanding of
    the connectional principles of feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) pathways. Quantitative
    analysis of retrograde tracers was used to extend the notion that the laminar
    distribution of neurons interconnecting visual areas provides an index of hierarchical
    distance (percentage of supragranular labeled neurons \[SLN\]). We show that:
    1) SLN values constrain models of cortical hierarchy, revealing previously unsuspected
    areal relations; 2) SLN reflects the operation of a combinatorial distance rule
    acting differentially on sets of connections between areas; 3) Supragranular layers
    contain highly segregated bottom-up and top-down streams, both of which exhibit
    point-to-point connectivity. This contrasts with the infragranular layers, which
    contain diffuse bottom-up and top-down streams; 4) Cell filling of the parent
    neurons of FF and FB pathways provides further evidence of compartmentalization;
    5) FF pathways have higher weights, cross fewer hierarchical levels, and are less
    numerous than FB pathways. Taken together, the present results suggest that cortical
    hierarchies are built from supra- and infragranular counterstreams. This compartmentalized
    dual counterstream organization allows point-to-point connectivity in both bottom-up
    and top-down directions.'

  title: Inferring learning rules from distributions of firing rates in cortical neurons
  container-title: Nature Neuroscience
  page: 1804-1810
  volume: '18'
  issue: '12'
  abstract: Information about external stimuli is thought to be stored in cortical
    circuits through experience-dependent modifications of synaptic connectivity.
    These modifications of network connectivity should lead to changes in neuronal
    activity as a particular stimulus is repeatedly encountered. Here we ask what
    plasticity rules are consistent with the differences in the statistics of the
    visual response to novel and familiar stimuli in inferior temporal cortex, an
    area underlying visual object recognition. We introduce a method that allows one
    to infer the dependence of the presumptive learning rule on postsynaptic firing
    rate, and we show that the inferred learning rule exhibits depression for low
    postsynaptic rates and potentiation for high rates. The threshold separating depression
    from potentiation is strongly correlated with both mean and s.d. of the firing
    rate distribution. Finally, we show that network models implementing a rule extracted
    from data show stable learning dynamics and lead to sparser representations of
    stimuli.

  title: A systems-neuroscience model of phasic dopamine
  abstract: We describe a neurobiologically informed computational model of the phasic
    dopamine signal- ing system that can account for a wider range of phenomena than
    simpler reward prediction error (RPE) accounts. The central feature of this PVLV
    framework is the distinction between a Primary Value (PV) system for anticipating
    the onset of primary rewards (USs), and a Learned Value (LV) system for learning
    about stimuli associated with such rewards (CSs). The LV system corresponds to
    the amygdala and its ability to drive phasic dopamine bursting in midbrain dopamine
    areas, while the PV system represents the ventral striatum (principally the nucleus
    accumbens, NAc), which drives shunting inhibition of dopamine for expected USs
    (via direct inhibitory projections) and phasic pausing for expected USs (via the
    lateral habenula, LHb). We show how our model can account for a range of data
    supporting the separability of these systems, including the non-zero- sum nature
    of CS and US firing, and individual differences in CS-based learning (sign-tracking)
    vs. US-based learning (goal-tracking). A critical feature of both systems is the
    use of opponent- processing pathways that represent the competing strengths of
    the evidence in favor and opposed to specific USs, and we show how these pathways
    can explain a range of important data dissociat- ing the processes involved in
    acquisition vs. extinction conditioning, including rapid reaquisition, reinstatement,
    and renewal. Furthermore, this opponent structure is critical for being able to
    ac- count for the full range of conditioned inhibition phenomena, and the surprisingly
    closely-related paradigm of second-order conditioning. Finally, we show how additional
    separable pathways rep- resenting aversive USs, which largely mirror those for
    appetitive USs, also have some important differences from the positive valence
    case, which allow the model to account for several important phenomena in aversive
    conditioning. Overall, the ability to account for all of these phenomena strongly
    constrains the form of the model, which thus provides a well-validated framework
    for understanding phasic dopamine signaling.

  title: Invariant visual representation by single neurons in the human brain
  container-title: Nature
  page: 1102-1107
  volume: '435'
  issue: '7045'
  abstract: It takes a fraction of a second to recognize a person or an object even
    when seen under strikingly different conditions. How such a robust, high-level
    representation is achieved by neurons in the human brain is still unclear1,2,3,4,5,6.
    In monkeys, neurons in the upper stages of the ventral visual pathway respond
    to complex images such as faces and objects and show some degree of invariance
    to metric properties such as the stimulus size, position and viewing angle2,4,7,8,9,10,11,12.
    We have previously shown that neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL)
    fire selectively to images of faces, animals, objects or scenes13,14. Here we
    report on a remarkable subset of MTL neurons that are selectively activated by
    strikingly different pictures of given individuals, landmarks or objects and in
    some cases even by letter strings with their names. These results suggest an invariant,
    sparse and explicit code, which might be important in the transformation of complex
    visual percepts into long-term and more abstract memories.

  title-short: The basal ganglia
  container-title: Progress in Neurobiology
  page: 381-425
  volume: '50'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: The basal ganglia comprise several nuclei in the forebrain, diencephalon,
    and midbrain thought to play a significant role in the control of posture and
    movement. It is well recognized that people with degenerative diseases of the
    basal ganglia suffer from rigidly held abnormal body postures, slowing of movement,
    involuntary movements, or a combination of these a abnormalities. However, it
    has not been agreed just what the basal ganglia contribute to normal movement.
    Recent advances in knowledge of the basal ganglia circuitry, activity of basal
    ganglia neurons during movement, and the effect of basal ganglia lesions have
    led to a new hypothesis of basal ganglia function. The hypothesis states that
    the basal ganglia do not generate movements. Instead, when voluntary movement
    is generated by cerebral cortical and cerebellar mechanisms, the basal ganglia
    act broadly to inhibit competing motor mechanisms that would otherwise interfere
    with the desired movement. Simultaneously, inhibition is removed focally from
    the desired motor mechanisms to allow that movement to proceed. Inability to inhibit
    competing motor programs results in slow movements, abnormal postures and involuntary
    muscle activity.

  title: Nucleus accumbens D2R cells signal prior outcomes and control risky decision-making
  container-title: Nature
  page: 642-646
  volume: '531'
  issue: '7596'
  abstract: A marked bias towards risk aversion has been observed in nearly every
    species tested. A minority of individuals, however, instead seem to prefer risk
    (repeatedly choosing uncertain large rewards over certain but smaller rewards),
    and even risk-averse individuals sometimes opt for riskier alternatives. It is
    not known how neural activity underlies such important shifts in decision-making—either
    as a stable trait across individuals or at the level of variability within individuals.
    Here we describe a model of risk-preference in rats, in which stable individual
    differences, trial-by-trial choices, and responses to pharmacological agents all
    parallel human behaviour. By combining new genetic targeting strategies with optical
    recording of neural activity during behaviour in this model, we identify relevant
    temporally specific signals from a genetically and anatomically defined population
    of neurons. This activity occurred within dopamine receptor type-2 (D2R)-expressing
    cells in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), signalled unfavourable outcomes from the
    recent past at a time appropriate for influencing subsequent decisions, and also
    predicted subsequent choices made. Having uncovered this naturally occurring neural
    correlate of risk selection, we then mimicked the temporally specific signal with
    optogenetic control during decision-making and demonstrated its causal effect
    in driving risk-preference. Specifically, risk-preferring rats could be instantaneously
    converted to risk-averse rats with precisely timed phasic stimulation of NAc D2R
    cells. These findings suggest that individual differences in risk-preference,
    as well as real-time risky decision-making, can be largely explained by the encoding
    in D2R-expressing NAc cells of prior unfavourable outcomes during decision-making.

  title-short: The hippocampal-VTA loop
  container-title: Neuron
  page: 703-713
  volume: '46'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: In this article we develop the concept that the hippo- campus and the
    midbrain dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) form a functional
    loop. Activation of the loop begins when the hippo- campus detects newly arrived
    information that is not already stored in its long-term memory. The resulting
    novelty signal is conveyed through the subiculum, accumbens, and ventral pallidum
    to the VTA where it contributes (along with salience and goal informa- tion) to
    the novelty-dependent firing of these cells. In the upward arm of the loop, dopamine
    (DA) is re- leased within the hippocampus; this produces an en- hancement of LTP
    and learning. These findings sup- port a model whereby the hippocampal-VTA loop
    regulates the entry of information into long-term memory.
