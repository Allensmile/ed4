  title: Invariant visual representation by single neurons in the human brain
  container-title: Nature
  page: 1102-1107
  volume: '435'
  issue: '7045'
  abstract: It takes a fraction of a second to recognize a person or an object even
    when seen under strikingly different conditions. How such a robust, high-level
    representation is achieved by neurons in the human brain is still unclear1,2,3,4,5,6.
    In monkeys, neurons in the upper stages of the ventral visual pathway respond
    to complex images such as faces and objects and show some degree of invariance
    to metric properties such as the stimulus size, position and viewing angle2,4,7,8,9,10,11,12.
    We have previously shown that neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL)
    fire selectively to images of faces, animals, objects or scenes13,14. Here we
    report on a remarkable subset of MTL neurons that are selectively activated by
    strikingly different pictures of given individuals, landmarks or objects and in
    some cases even by letter strings with their names. These results suggest an invariant,
    sparse and explicit code, which might be important in the transformation of complex
    visual percepts into long-term and more abstract memories.

  title: Adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model as an effective description
    of neuronal activity
  container-title: Journal of Neurophysiology
  page: 3637-3642
  volume: '94'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: We introduce a two-dimensional integrate-and-fire model that combines
    an exponential spike mechanism with an adaptation equation, based on recent theoretical
    findings. We describe a systematic method to estimate its parameters with simple
    electrophysiological protocols (current-clamp injection of pulses and ramps) and
    apply it to a detailed conductance-based model of a regular spiking neuron. Our
    simple model predicts correctly the timing of 96% of the spikes ($\pm$2 ms) of
    the detailed model in response to injection of noisy synaptic conductances. The
    model is especially reliable in high-conductance states, typical of cortical activity
    in vivo, in which intrinsic conductances were found to have a reduced role in
    shaping spike trains. These results are promising because this simple model has
    enough expressive power to reproduce qualitatively several electrophysiological
    classes described in vitro.
