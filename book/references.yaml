    of neuronal activity

  abstract: We introduce a two-dimensional integrate-and-fire model that combines
    an exponential spike mechanism with an adaptation equation, based on recent theoretical
    findings. We describe a systematic method to estimate its parameters with simple
    electrophysiological protocols (current-clamp injection of pulses and ramps) and
    apply it to a detailed conductance-based model of a regular spiking neuron. Our
    simple model predicts correctly the timing of 96% of the spikes ($\pm$2 ms) of
    the detailed model in response to injection of noisy synaptic conductances. The
    model is especially reliable in high-conductance states, typical of cortical activity
    in vivo, in which intrinsic conductances were found to have a reduced role in
    shaping spike trains. These results are promising because this simple model has
    enough expressive power to reproduce qualitatively several electrophysiological
    classes described in vitro.
