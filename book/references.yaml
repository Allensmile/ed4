  title: 'Deep predictive learning: A comprehensive model of three visual streams'
  title-short: Deep Predictive Learning
  container-title: arXiv:1709.04654 \[q-bio\]
  abstract: 'How does the neocortex learn and develop the foundations of all our high-level
    cognitive abilities? We present a comprehensive framework spanning biological,
    computational, and cognitive levels, with a clear theoretical continuity between
    levels, providing a coherent answer directly supported by extensive data at each
    level. Learning is based on making predictions about what the senses will report
    at 100 msec (alpha frequency) intervals, and adapting synaptic weights to improve
    prediction accuracy. The pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus serves as a projection
    screen upon which predictions are generated, through deep-layer 6 corticothalamic
    inputs from multiple brain areas and levels of abstraction. The sparse driving
    inputs from layer 5 intrinsic bursting neurons provide the target signal, and
    the temporal difference between it and the prediction reverberates throughout
    the cortex, driving synaptic changes that approximate error backpropagation, using
    only local activation signals in equations derived directly from a detailed biophysical
    model. In vision, predictive learning requires a carefully-organized developmental
    progression and anatomical organization of three pathways (What, Where, and What
    \* Where), according to two central principles: top-down input from compact, high-level,
    abstract representations is essential for accurate prediction of low-level sensory
    inputs; and the collective, low-level prediction error must be progressively and
    opportunistically partitioned to enable extraction of separable factors that drive
    the learning of further high-level abstractions. Our model self-organized systematic
    invariant object representations of 100 different objects from simple movies,
    accounts for a wide range of data, and makes many testable predictions.'

  container-title: Nature

  volume: '435'
  issue: '7045'
  abstract: It takes a fraction of a second to recognize a person or an object even
    when seen under strikingly different conditions. How such a robust, high-level
    representation is achieved by neurons in the human brain is still unclear1,2,3,4,5,6.
    In monkeys, neurons in the upper stages of the ventral visual pathway respond
    to complex images such as faces and objects and show some degree of invariance
    to metric properties such as the stimulus size, position and viewing angle2,4,7,8,9,10,11,12.
    We have previously shown that neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL)
    fire selectively to images of faces, animals, objects or scenes13,14. Here we
    report on a remarkable subset of MTL neurons that are selectively activated by
    strikingly different pictures of given individuals, landmarks or objects and in
    some cases even by letter strings with their names. These results suggest an invariant,
    sparse and explicit code, which might be important in the transformation of complex
    visual percepts into long-term and more abstract memories.

  title-short: Nonmonotonic Plasticity

  page: 726-742
  volume: '23'
  issue: '9'
  abstract: What are the principles that govern whether neural representations move
    apart (differentiate) or together (integrate) as a function of learning? According
    to supervised learning models that are trained to predict outcomes in the world,
    integration should occur when two stimuli predict the same outcome. Numerous findings
    support this, but paradoxically some recent fMRI studies have found that pairing
    different stimuli with the same associate causes differentiation, not integration.
    To explain these and related findings, we argue that supervised learning needs
    to be supplemented with unsupervised learning that is driven by spreading activation
    in a U-shaped way, such that inactive memories are not modified, moderate activation
    of memories causes weakening (leading to differentiation), and higher activation
    causes strengthening (leading to integration).

  title: Adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model as an effective description
    of neuronal activity
  container-title: Journal of Neurophysiology
  page: 3637-3642
  volume: '94'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: We introduce a two-dimensional integrate-and-fire model that combines
    an exponential spike mechanism with an adaptation equation, based on recent theoretical
    findings. We describe a systematic method to estimate its parameters with simple
    electrophysiological protocols (current-clamp injection of pulses and ramps) and
    apply it to a detailed conductance-based model of a regular spiking neuron. Our
    simple model predicts correctly the timing of 96% of the spikes ($\pm$2 ms) of
    the detailed model in response to injection of noisy synaptic conductances. The
    model is especially reliable in high-conductance states, typical of cortical activity
    in vivo, in which intrinsic conductances were found to have a reduced role in
    shaping spike trains. These results are promising because this simple model has
    enough expressive power to reproduce qualitatively several electrophysiological
    classes described in vitro.

    Timing, Synaptic Strength, and Postsynaptic Cell Type'
  title-short: Synaptic Modifications in Cultured Hippocampal Neurons
  container-title: The Journal of Neuroscience
  page: 10464-10472
  volume: '18'
  issue: '24'
  abstract: In cultures of dissociated rat hippocampal neurons, persistent potentiation
    and depression of glutamatergic synapses were induced by correlated spiking of
    presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. The relative timing between the presynaptic
    and postsynaptic spiking determined the direction and the extent of synaptic changes.
    Repetitive postsynaptic spiking within a time window of 20 msec after presynaptic
    activation resulted in long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas postsynaptic spiking
    within a window of 20 msec before the repetitive presynaptic activation led to
    long-term depression (LTD). Significant LTP occurred only at synapses with relatively
    low initial strength, whereas the extent of LTD did not show obvious dependence
    on the initial synaptic strength. Both LTP and LTD depended on the activation
    of NMDA receptors and were absent in cases in which the postsynaptic neurons were
    GABAergic in nature. Blockade of L-type calcium channels with nimodipine abolished
    the induction of LTD and reduced the extent of LTP. These results underscore the
    importance of precise spike timing, synaptic strength, and postsynaptic cell type
    in the activity-induced modification of central synapses and suggest that Hebb’s
    rule may need to incorporate a quantitative consideration of spike timing that
    reflects the narrow and asymmetric window for the induction of synaptic modification.

  title: Inferring learning rules from distributions of firing rates in cortical neurons
  container-title: Nature Neuroscience
  page: 1804-1810
  volume: '18'
  issue: '12'
  abstract: Information about external stimuli is thought to be stored in cortical
    circuits through experience-dependent modifications of synaptic connectivity.
    These modifications of network connectivity should lead to changes in neuronal
    activity as a particular stimulus is repeatedly encountered. Here we ask what
    plasticity rules are consistent with the differences in the statistics of the
    visual response to novel and familiar stimuli in inferior temporal cortex, an
    area underlying visual object recognition. We introduce a method that allows one
    to infer the dependence of the presumptive learning rule on postsynaptic firing
    rate, and we show that the inferred learning rule exhibits depression for low
    postsynaptic rates and potentiation for high rates. The threshold separating depression
    from potentiation is strongly correlated with both mean and s.d. of the firing
    rate distribution. Finally, we show that network models implementing a rule extracted
    from data show stable learning dynamics and lead to sparser representations of
    stimuli.
